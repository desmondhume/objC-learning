Exercises from "Programming in Objective-C - 6th Edition" by Stephen G.Kochan

This repository is organized in different branches, one for each chapter of the book (eg. ```program-looping```).  
To keep the code base slim, I just implemented a class for each chapter as well (eg. ```Loop```).  
In each class, you'll find a class method with the format:

```
/*
Here is the assignment of the exercise
*/
+ (void)exerciseN;
```
where ```N ``` is the number of the exercise in the chapter.


In the ```main.m```, simply call ```[Class exerciseN]``` to execute the solution to the corresponding exercise.


**Have fun and keep learning!**
